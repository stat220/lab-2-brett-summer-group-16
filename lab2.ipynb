    "\n",
    "  It was with great excitement that we received your missive, and we are pleased to offer our humble assistance to your band of adventurers. As purveyors of knowledge and staunch believers in empowering the brave souls who roam the land, we too believe that every hero should know the odds they face when standing against the world's growing perils.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In response to your urgent request, we have crafted two invaluable tools—arcane in their nature yet simple in their use—to guide your patrons in their endeavors. The first, known as \"calc_mdn_pr_sum,\" grants the power to calculate the probability of rolling m quantity of n-sided dice, ensuring the total exceeds a desired threshold. The second, \"calc_mdn_pr,\" calculates the odds that, out of m rolls of n-sided dice, at least one will yield a value equal to or greater than a chosen number.\n",
    "\n",
    "  However, it should be noted that these calculations do not account for any modifiers your adventurers may possess—whether magical, martial, or otherwise. The tools focus purely on the raw probabilities of the dice rolls themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "  With these tools at their disposal, your adventurers shall gain keen insight into the chances that fate has in store for them, better prepared to face whatever dangers lie ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "  May your tavern thrive, and may fortune favor your brave patrons.\n"
